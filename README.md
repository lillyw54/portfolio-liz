    THE WHY:
In this project I focused on creating a simple landing page for employers to see projects refactored, or created by me; with time it'll continue being updated to represent the growth.

* Each position and color was carefully thought out to engage with the user. Starting with the header: with a quirky saying "finding the puzzle piece together" every software developer goes through the process of breaking the page, to fix it and finding the proper puzzle pieces to create the vision they had. 
* Followed by a picture of my daughter and I; as an engagment, and personal feel with the user. 
* I wanted to incorporate in one of my columns an "about me" so the user knows more than just the surface. It's always great for someone to know the work, but it makes it easier when the person has a personality and a reason why they are striving for greatness. 
* In the following column named "repository links" I added a working link that will lead you to my repos, this was created as an easy access for those wanting to know more about my work or to even contribute. 
* When it comes to the footer, It was meant to be something encouring yet simple. 

    THE HOW:

Starting I wanted to create a layout: Header, columns, and footer. To create this in the CSS file I used W3Schools as a guide to have a better understanding in what the layout of each section would be. 
Attached is the layout URL:
    https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp 

For the same Header, columns, and footer created; in HTML I used the following W3Schools website as a guide. Not all sections were used, but it gave a better understanding of what I needed, to tie the HTML and CSS code together.

The image of my daughter and I, was added by creating a folder under "images" with the selected image in said folder. After this an an "absolute path" was created.  <img src= "/images/lnk.png">

Attached are the following layout Url's:
* header:
     https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
* img container: 
    https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp
* semantics for columns and sections:
     https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
  
    CONTRIBUTING:
  
  If you would like to contribute, and add to the portfolio layout, ensure that you're adding a section to the README fileas well, showing what was changed to make it better.
